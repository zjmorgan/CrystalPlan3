The above matrix is the Transpose of the UB Matrix. The UB matrix maps the column 
vector (h,k,l ) to the column vector (q'x,q'y,q'z).
|Q'|=1/dspacing and its coordinates are a right-hand coordinate system where 
 x is the beam direction and z is vertically upward.(IPNS convention)


Note: Oxalic acid. 33 of 36 peaks indexed. LS optimized matrix.
