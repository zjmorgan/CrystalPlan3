This directory contains some of the packages that may be needed alongside
the iucr LaTeX macro package. There is no guarantee that these are complete
or up to date; however, I shall be pleased to update requested packages
upon request, whenever possible. Please direct any such requests to
bm@iucr.org.

A complete set of TeX and LaTeX public packages may be accessed through CTAN,
the Complete TeX Archive Network (e.g. http://tug2.cs.umb.edu/ctan/ or
http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/)
